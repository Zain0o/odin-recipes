<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.</p>

<ul>

<li>Dough:

    Â¼ cup warm water
    
    1 teaspoon active dry yeast
    
    1 cup cold water
    
    1 teaspoon salt
    
    3 cups bread flour
    
    1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>



</ul>

<h2>STEPS</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
<li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
</ol>
